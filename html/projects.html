						MC-VSG Control is the command/control application required by the X-COM Multi-Channel Vector Signal Generator.  The MC-VSG is a four channel by 150+ MSa/S I/Q playback device capable of achieving up to 3.2 GB/S of RF playback.  The control UI allows the user to complete playbacks, sequence files, view file meta data, and configure numerous operational settings on the device.  Furthermore, the interface is capable of controlling up to five simulataneous MC-VSG devices.  This presents a series of technical problems as each must be regularly polled and manipulated via UDP due to the limited capabilities of the on-board Power-PC processor.  
					</p>
					<br/>
					<p class="projects">
						To solve these hurdles, the application (C#.NET/WPF) utilizes complex multi-threading schemes for the polling and UI logic, layers of inheritance hierarchies to aid in the management of devices and device types, and advanced C#.NET features such as generics and reflection.  It also includes a build-in TCP/IP API for use with unit-testing and hardware stress-testing.  The project is primarily MVVM where applicable in order to isolate the interface (of which there are many different views for any given view model), the view models, and the models and UDP data layers.
					</p>
					<br/>
					<p class="projects">
						The result of this complexity is an application which is an aesthetically pleasing powerhouse capable of tracking and displaying multitudes of complex state information to a user at any given time without the need for explicit interaction.
					</p>
					<br/>
					<p class="projects">
						The product is currently in use by various DoD entities and DoD contractors.

						X-COM Control is the command/control application required by the X-COM IQC 5000 A/B series products.  The IQC is a two channel I/Q record/playback system capable of up to 1.6 GB/S of sustained playback or record operations into SSD RAIDs capable of storing up to 32 TB of data.  X-COM Control enables users to configure, execute, and monitor recordings and playbacks of various types, sort through file metadata and marker information, and manage the files.  Built-in PCIe driver capabilities allow recorded data to be downloaded at up to 1GB/S.  
					</p>
					<br/>
					<p class="projects">
						The project is primarily C#.NET/WPF with an underlying interoperability layer which interfaces with the unmanaged C/C++ driver calls and optimized, high-speed transfer code.  Communication with the IQC requires a deep stack of UDP-based state retrieval logic, in which hundreds of registers need to be read and analyzed in order to determine the machine's current state, which is passed to the view layer through the view model.
